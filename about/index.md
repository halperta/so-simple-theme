I am a CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow in Data Curation for Latin American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin (2017-2019). From 2015-2017, I managed the Reading the First Books project at LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections. As a CLIR fellow, I am working with the digital archive of the Policía Nacional de Guatemala as part of the post-custodial digital archiving initiatives at LLILAS Benson. I earned my PhD in comparative literature from the University of Texas at Austin in 2017.

I am an associate professor in Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Texas at Austin. My research has focused on how indigenous people—specifically Nahuas in Mexico—have utilized the written word to shape and respond to modernity as intellectuals within and beyond their communities of origin, from the colonial period through the present day. This broad research goal encompasses three primary fields: 1) Colonial/Postcolonial Latin American Literary/Cultural Studies; 2) Critical Indigenous Studies; and 3) Ethnohistory. In my first book, The Learned Ones: Nahua Intellectuals in Postconquest Mexico (University of Arizona Press, First Peoples: New Directions in Indigenous Studies, 2014), I challenged the commonly held assumption that indigenous intellectual activities in Latin America ceased or decreased dramatically with the advent of the European conquest and colonization. As evidence, I explored specific cases of Nahua writing and intellectualism from the past five centuries. My current work deals with indigenous (primarily Nahua) science and technology.

# Course Description

This course will use three newly developed Latin American digital archives to explore theoretical and practical issues related to their creation and access (the latter in the broadest terms: physical, technical, community, post-custodial, etc.). With emphasis on critical archive theory and state-of-the-art digital humanities approaches, this course draws from literary & cultural studies, critical indigenous studies, history, art history, and anthropology as we build a rigorous theoretical framework and engage in hands-on practice.

* We will begin with the [John Carter Brown Library](https://www.brown.edu/academics/libraries/john-carter-brown/) Latin American Digital Collections (JCB), with emphasis on Book History and Native Studies, in order to understand how archives actually come to be. Where did all of this stuff come from anyway? how did it get to Providence? How are digital archives designed/curated, and in what ways can this design create and/or perpetuate unequal power structures? What are possible decolonial archival practices that can be deployed? What are best practices for actually utilizing digital archives for scholarly work?

* The second archive is the [Digital Archive of the Guatemalan National Police Historical Archive](https://ahpn.lib.utexas.edu/) (AHPN), a collaborative project between LLILAS-Benson and the Rapoport Center for Human Rights at UT Austin, and the AHPN. With materials related to the 1975-1985 Civil War in Guatemala, this behemoth (some 80 million documents) archive “is the largest single repository of documents ever made available to human rights investigators.”[1](https://ahpn.lib.utexas.edu/about_ahpn) How do you create an accessible, easily searchable, digital archive of this size and complexity that best serves human rights workers and affected families? What are the technical aspects of such an undertaking?

* Finally, our third archive is the Fondo Real de Cholula (FRC), which is being digitized in Summer 2018 as a joint project between Kelly McDonough (UT Austin) and Lidia García-Gómez (BUAP, Mexico). Only recently discovered, the FRC is the judicial archive of Cholula, Mexico, spanning the early colonial period through independence, the Porfiriato, and much of the 20th century. As we identify and study indigenous, female, and afro-descendant cases in the archive, we will also consider issues of community engagement and working with cultural heritage sources. What are our ethical responsibilities when dealing with digitization projects in a transnational context? What is our obligation to the communities of origin?

Approximately half of the course will consist of readings, discussion, and workshops related to the archives. This course will be supported by LLILAS-Benson Digital Scholarship and Rare Books Collection specialists. 

The final grade will be primarily based on a semester-long portfolio with small essays or digital projects from each of the archives, a series of meta-reflections. The final project will consist of a proposal and detailed outline for a research project related either to critical/digital archive theory or in a digital collection of the student’s choice.
