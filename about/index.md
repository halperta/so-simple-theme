This course will use three newly developed Latin American digital archives to explore theoretical and practical issues related to their creation and access (the latter in the broadest terms: physical, technical, community, post-custodial, etc.). With emphasis on critical archive theory and state-of-the-art digital humanities approaches, this course draws from literary & cultural studies, critical indigenous studies, history, art history, and anthropology as we build a rigorous theoretical framework and engage in hands-on practice.

* We will begin with the [John Carter Brown Library](https://www.brown.edu/academics/libraries/john-carter-brown/) Latin American Digital Collections (JCB), with emphasis on Book History and Native Studies, in order to understand how archives actually come to be. Where did all of this stuff come from anyway? how did it get to Providence? How are digital archives designed/curated, and in what ways can this design create and/or perpetuate unequal power structures? What are possible decolonial archival practices that can be deployed? What are best practices for actually utilizing digital archives for scholarly work?

* The second archive is the [Digital Archive of the Guatemalan National Police Historical Archive](https://ahpn.lib.utexas.edu/) (AHPN), a collaborative project between LLILAS-Benson and the Rapoport Center for Human Rights at UT Austin, and the AHPN. With materials related to the 1975-1985 Civil War in Guatemala, this behemoth (some 80 million documents) archive “is the largest single repository of documents ever made available to human rights investigators.”[1](https://ahpn.lib.utexas.edu/about_ahpn) How do you create an accessible, easily searchable, digital archive of this size and complexity that best serves human rights workers and affected families? What are the technical aspects of such an undertaking?

* Finally, our third archive is the Fondo Real de Cholula (FRC), which is being digitized in Summer 2018 as a joint project between Kelly McDonough (UT Austin) and Lidia García-Gómez (BUAP, Mexico). Only recently discovered, the FRC is the judicial archive of Cholula, Mexico, spanning the early colonial period through independence, the Porfiriato, and much of the 20th century. As we identify and study indigenous, female, and afro-descendant cases in the archive, we will also consider issues of community engagement and working with cultural heritage sources. What are our ethical responsibilities when dealing with digitization projects in a transnational context? What is our obligation to the communities of origin?

Approximately half of the course will consist of readings, discussion, and workshops related to the archives. Workshops range from instruction on digital mapmaking and other visualization; understanding networks; scraping data, and paleography and transcription. This course will be supported by LLILAS-Benson Digital Scholarship and Rare Books Collection specialists. Since one of the key goals of this course is to grapple with theory meeting practice, we will meet regularly with a similar course through the School of Information (“Humanists and Archive Professionals meet and attempt to talk to each other”).

The final grade will be primarily based on a semester-long portfolio with small essays or digital projects from each of the archives, a series of meta-reflections. The final project will consist of a proposal and detailed outline for a research project related either to critical/digital archive theory or in a digital collection of the student’s choice.
