I am an associate professor in Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Texas at Austin. My research has focused on how indigenous people—specifically Nahuas in Mexico—have utilized the written word to shape and respond to modernity as intellectuals within and beyond their communities of origin, from the colonial period through the present day. This broad research goal encompasses three primary fields: 1) Colonial/Postcolonial Latin American Literary/Cultural Studies; 2) Critical Indigenous Studies; and 3) Ethnohistory. In my first book, The Learned Ones: Nahua Intellectuals in Postconquest Mexico (University of Arizona Press, First Peoples: New Directions in Indigenous Studies, 2014), I challenged the commonly held assumption that indigenous intellectual activities in Latin America ceased or decreased dramatically with the advent of the European conquest and colonization. As evidence, I explored specific cases of Nahua writing and intellectualism from the past five centuries. My current work deals with indigenous (primarily Nahua) science and technology.
